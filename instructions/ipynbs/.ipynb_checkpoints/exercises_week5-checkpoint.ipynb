    "You have run SPAdes on your laptop and on a remote computer last week. This week, you will be using SPAdes and specifically metaSPAdes to run a metagenome assembly on `cerberus`. SPAdes is a genome assembler that was originally design to assemble single-cell genomic data but has since evolved to become a multipurpose assembler able to handle a wide variety of sequencing data. The authors who developed the tool have written a specific version of SPAdes known as \"**metaSPAdes**\" that you will be using today in class. See here for the paper describing metaSPAdes: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5411777/.\n",

Next, you will be trimming your raw metagenomic reads using `bbduk.sh` tool you used a few weeks ago to trim away adapter regions and to improve sequence quality. You should be using the `sbatch` command to submit jobs on `cerberus` and not directly typing the commands in the terminal.\n",

    "\n",
    "Briefly, the tool checks for conserved single-copy marker genes present in microbial (bacterial and archaeal) genomes to determine how complete a genome assembly is and if there are any signs of contamination. Contamination is especially important factor to consider in metagenome-assembled genomes because binning tools are not perfect and they can sometimes put contigs originating from two organisms into the same bin, thereby creating an artifical genome construct that is not real. This will cause a lot of problems downstream when you are analyzing these genomes and discover that some contigs that don't belong are showing up in your analysis and thus throwing of your interpretation of the gene contents or other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is imperative that you carefully check for signs of contamination and to inspect MAGs that might have been contaminated through the binning process. CheckM is therefore useful for quickly assessing both completeness and contamination levels of assembled genomes. To install `checkm`, you can type `conda install checkm-genome` first to install it through `conda`. \n",

    "checkm data setRoot .\n",

    "So this sbatch script is directing `checkm` to look into the `binning/bins` subfolder where the MAGs are located. The `-x fa` just means to look for all files with extension \".fa\". It will run using 24 CPU cores as indicated by the `-t 24` option. It takes a while to get results in but at the end of the process, you wil have a text file name `CheckM.txt` which contains completeness and contamination estimates for the MAGs. You can see the contents of this text file by typing `cat CheckM.txt` to print file content to your terminal. "

    "The research group developed CheckM also developed a tool known as RefineM to automatically detect and remove contigs in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that may otherwise require manual intervention. This is very helpful if you have hundreds or thousands of MAGs to analyze. This tool automates the process. However, manual bin refinement is still important and should not be overlooked, especially for evolutionarily significant lineages that require careful analysis. You should have already installed RefineM tool using `conda`. I have provided an example sbatch script below on how to run `refinem` on `cerberus`.\n",

    "This script assumes that you have already run metagenomic binning using Metabat2. The files that `refinem` are expecting have been produced as a result of `metabat2` run that was previously performed. At the end of this process, you will have a folder named `filtered_bins` which will contain refined bins/MAGs (same number as produced by Metabat2) that should have cleaner bins with most likely contaminants removed from them. To really test whether or not this bin refinement worked, you should ideally run `checkm` again on these filtered bins to see if the metrics improved or not."
