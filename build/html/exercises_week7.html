<h2>Install and run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prokka</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#install-and-run-prokka" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Today, you will install and run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prokka</span></code>, a tool written by Torsten
Seemann, who also wrote the tool <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">barrnap</span></code> you used last week. This is
a tool to automatically annotate bacterial or archaeal genomes rapidly.
See here for the original paper describing
<a class="reference external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24642063/">Prokka</a> and the Github
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tseemann/prokka">page</a> to see how to run this
tool.</p>
<p>Back in the old days, microbial genome annotation involves first
predicting open reading frames (ORFs) first, then running BLAST searches
against known reference databases from NCBI in order to predict
biological functions of coding sequences identified from microbial
genomes. This involves carefully sifting through thousands of BLAST
search results and manually checking them before assigning putative
functions. We’ve come a long way from those days and now you can run
tools like Prokka to quickly predict both amino acid and RNA coding
regions in microbial genomes. Though it does a good job of assigning
functions to these hypothetical proteins, it is not perfect and careful
manual checking would still be considered a good practice to make sure
that proteins are not misannotated.</p>
<p>Misannotated proteins are a big problem because there is almost no way
for someone to manually check them for accuracy before they get
submitted to Genbank for archival. These errenous records then get
propagated when someone searches for an unknown protein of interest,
found a misannotated protein, then use that functional assignment as
true. So, although we use Prokka to routinely annotate microbial genomes
prior to submission to the NCBI, a better way to make sure the genomes
are properly annotated is to use NCBI’s Prokaryotic Genome Annotation
Pipeline (PGAP) tool
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/</a>).</p>
<p>This tool is good because it is a tool used by NCBI to check and make
sure functional annotations are consistent and conform to NCBI’s
standards. PGAP is available as a web tool (used when you submit a
microbial genome for archival) or as a standalone tool
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ncbi/pgap">https://github.com/ncbi/pgap</a>). However, it takes quite a bit of space
to install and run it (100 GB). Because of this, we won’t be using this
tool in class this time but Prokka to annotate microbial genomes.</p>
<p>Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span></code> to install Prokka either on your laptop or on
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cerberus</span></code>. Prokka is pretty light-weight tool that it will still run
quite well if you run it on your laptop computer. However, it has some
issues installing it through <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span></code> right off the bat. You should use
the following command to create a virtual environment for Prokka and
then activate the environment before running it.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>conda create -n prokka_env -c conda-forge -c bioconda prokka

conda activate prokka_env
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The latest version is 1.14.6. Once it’s installed, it is quite easy to
run Prokka to annotate a genome. In today’s exercise, you will choose
one of the MAGs you have obtained from a Metabat2 binning of your
metaSPAdes assembly from last week. Just take one of the bins to run
Prokka on (if the bin has a 16S, it would be easier to identify its
lineage but bins without 16S are also ok to choose).</p>
<p>An example command to run Prokka is shown below.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>prokka --outdir prokka_out --prefix bin10 --cpus <span class="m">4</span> bin.10.fa
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you are running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prokka</span></code> on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cerberus</span></code>, please make sure to use
an sbatch script to run it (<strong>Do not run it on the login node</strong>). The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prokka_out</span></code> folder is the directory in which you will find Prokka
results. In this case, I am using 4 CPU cores to run it. After the
Prokka run has finished, go into the folder and see what files are being
produced. The files ending with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.faa</span></code> contains amino acid sequences
of coding regions identified in a given microbial genome. This is the
file you will need for the next part of the exercise today. The file
that ends with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.tsv</span></code> contains tab-delimited entries of coding
regions identified and their functional assignments.</p>
<p>Look through the results to see what kind of functional proteins are
being predicted by Prokka. The file that ends with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.gbf</span></code> is a
Genbank format file containing both DNA and amino acid sequences of the
genome and detailed annotations of the regions (such as coordinates of
the genes identified along the genome and on which contig, for example).
The file that ends with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.ffn</span></code> contains coding DNA sequences (genes)
instead of the amino acid sequences that were translated from the
primary DNA sequence. These are the main file formats you should be
familiar with.</p>
<p>Prokka also produced files with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.err</span></code> in which you will find some
errors or problems encountered by Prokka during this run. The file that
ends with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.val</span></code> contains messages from the NCBI validation tool
that can check for mistakes in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.sqn</span></code> files that was generated as part
of the pipeline and is the file you will need to submit to NCBI Genbank
when submitting a genome there.</p>

<h2>Introduction to KEGG and GhostKOALA<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-kegg-and-ghostkoala" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Today, you will use this web-based tool known as GhostKOALA, which is a
tool used for functional characterization of genomes and metagenomes.
See the paper describing the tool here:
<a class="reference external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26585406/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26585406/</a>. It is a tool to automatically
assign KEGG Orthology (KO) to any genomic sequences of any origin (both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes). KEGG stands for Kyoto Encyclopedia for
Genes and Genomes and the website can be found here:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg/">https://www.genome.jp/kegg/</a>. KEGG is a really useful database for
biologists to identify, characterize, and reconstruct metabolic pathways
in their organisms of interest and to see whether they might be able to
perform certain metabolic functions based on proteins identified in
their genomes.</p>
<p>KEGG website also as this KAAS tool (KEGG Automatic Annotation Server),
which performs similar functions as GhostKOALA. But GhostKOALA is
becoming more popular to use because it can also handle metagenomic
data. KAAS is meant for single genomes. KEGG also maintains a database
of genomes with KEGG annotations so that you can quickly look up their
metabolic pathway maps. For example, if you click on this link
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg/genome.html">https://www.genome.jp/kegg/genome.html</a>) and choose “KEGG organisms”, it
will give you a list of organisms (both prokaryotes and eukaryotes), the
year in which their genomes were sequenced, their source of genomic
sequence, and urls taking you to the annotated page of a particular
genome. If you are interested in looking at the pathway map of <em>E. coli</em>
O157:H7 (there are many!) which causes enterohemorrhagic colitis, click
here as an example:
https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_organism?org=ece.</p>
<p>This brings you to a summary page of this organism and show you a bunch
of things including papers describing the organism/genome. Click on the
“Pathway map” link near the top. This will give you a list of metabolic
pathways identified in this genome. Click on link to “Pathogenic
Escherichia coli infection”
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ece05130">https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ece05130</a>) and you will see
a number of proteins and pathways identified involved in causing this
disease. This pathway is a bit more complicated because it describes not
just the pathogenic components in <em>E. coli</em> but also how the host immune
system responds to the infection. As the map shows, you can see that
this pathogenic <em>E. coli</em> uses the Type III secretion system to deliver
effectors into host cells. Those highlighted in green indicates they are
present in genes encoded in this particular <em>E. coli</em>’s genome. You
can also see which effectors are causing problems or interferring with
host immune system components.</p>
<p>Now, go back to the previous page showing a list of metabolic pathways.
Click on a pathway that’s something else other than disease related. For
example, click on “Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis” and it will show you the
pathway map showing all the components (both metabolites and enzymes)
involved in the pathway. Again, those in green indicate these enzymes
are present in this <em>E. coli</em> genome. Click on the green icon with the
numbers “5.4.2.2”. These are what we called “Enzyme Commission” numbers.
We will come back to these numbers in a bit. So this particular enzyme
is known as phosphoglucomutase, which is responsible for interconverting
D-Glucose 1-phosphate and alpha-D-Glucose 6-phosphate. In this page
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ece:Z0837">https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ece:Z0837</a>) you can see both
the DNA and amino acid sequences of this enzyme. On the right, you will
see a number of links. Click on “KEGG REACTION” link. You will see 3
reaction identification numbers and their definitions. Click on the
first one. It will show you chemical structures of the two metabolites
that this enzyme can interconvert.</p>
<p>Click a few more additional metabolic pathway maps to explore the
enzymes and metabolites found in them. In some pathways, if there are a
lot of blanks (white boxes) for certain enzymes, then these pathways may
not be complete and the organism may not be able to perform the stated
functions. These are incomplete pathways and this may indicate that the
organism may have at some point in their evolutionary history hosted a
complete pathway but losing it due to gene loss. This happens a lot in
strictly endosymbiotic organisms (such as bacteria found in the cells of
aphids or other insects, for example). They have become endosymbiotic
organisms and may rely on the host to provide some of the nutrients in
exchange for something that they produce.</p>
<p>Go back to the list of KEGG organisms page and click on <em>Buchnera
aphidicola</em> APS (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_organism?org=buc">https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_organism?org=buc</a>).
This is an organism that has co-evolved together with pea aphid and in
the process of their co-evolution, lost a significant number of genes
and now left with a very reduced genome of roughly 640K bases. Click on
the pathway map. From the list of pathways, explore those related to
“Amino acid metabolism”. Can you identify which pathways are incomplete?
And can you identify which amino acids the organism is unable to
synthesize on its own?</p>

<h2>Running GhostKOALA on one of the genomes annotated by Prokka<a class="headerlink" href="#running-ghostkoala-on-one-of-the-genomes-annotated-by-prokka" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Next, you will take one of the genomes annotated by Prokka earlier and
submit it to GhostKOALA website (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.kegg.jp/ghostkoala/">https://www.kegg.jp/ghostkoala/</a>) to
annotate and reconstruct pathway maps in your MAGs. Chose one of the
MAGs you have just annotated using Prokka and upload it to GhostKOALA
website. There is an option to upload your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.faa</span></code> files in this page.
After clicking on “Browse” button and uploading your amino acid
sequences, choose “genus_prokaryotes” option below, provide your email
address in a box below, then click on “Request for email confirmation”
button. You will get an email to confirm your job request and will need
to click on the link in this email in order to proceed with this
automatic annotation.</p>
<p>After that, you will wait a few minutes and you will get another email
telling you that the job has finished and with a link to the annotation
page. Once you get a URL to the annotation page, click on that and you
will see two pie charts showing summaries of metabolic functions
identified in your genome and a taxonomic breakdown of the proteins
identified. Click on “Reconstruct Pathway” link and explore some of the
pathways identified. Can you tell which ones are complete or incomplete?
This is a time-consuming step because there can be thousands of enzymes
involved in the pathways it is not easy to go through them all quickly.
This is the part you will spend a lot of time one when analyzing a
genome.</p>
<p>To speed up analysis, click on “Module” tab near the top of the page.
Here, the KEGG mapper has automatically identified complete metabolic
modules in this genome. Metabolic modules are sub-components or blocks
of pathways that are part of a bigger pathway map. For example, within
the Glycolysis pathway, you can have “M00001 Glycolysis (Embden-Meyerhof
pathway), glucose =&gt; pyruvate” and “M00002 Glycolysis, core module
involving three-carbon compounds”. By default, it will only list the
complete modules. If you click on one of the radio buttons for
“including 1 block missing” and click “Exec”, it will list additional
modules that are nearly complete but missing one block. This helps you
to identify if some pathways might be nearly complete and if one enzyme
is missing due to misannotation. You can also take steps to look for a
missing enzyme to see if it’s missing due to incomplete nature of the
genome or due to something else.</p>
<p>Click on one of the complete modules and see what it shows and compare
it with one of the incomplete modules (missing 1 block). Can you
identify what’s missing in one of the incomplete modules and what they
are? Based on some of the complete modules, what you can deduce from
looking at the metabolic pathway maps of this organism?</p>
