    "SPAdes was originally designed as a tool to assemble single-cell genomic sequences that usualy comprise uneven sequence coverage. In order to be able to discern such unenven coverages, the authors developed special algorithms to detect such coverages and to account for such regions. Also, to correct for errors that might be introduced during multiple-displacement amplification (MDA), SPAdes incorporates an \"error-correction\" step to improve sequence quality in those regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since its intial development in 2012, the assembler has evolved to be able to handle different types of sequencing technologies and datasets. Now, it can handle not only single-cell genomic data but also genomic sequences from isolate genomes (cultures), metagenomes. It can also handle latest \"next-gen sequencing\" (NGS) data such as PacBio, Nanopore, etc. SPAdes is hosted at this website (https://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/) but you can also visit their github page to see the latest version here (https://github.com/ablab/spades). The github page contains most updated information on how to run SPAdes and what options you can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's computational exercise, you will use SPAdes to assemble a microbial genome sequenced with Illumina sequencing technology. In order to be able to run SPAdes, you will need to install SPAdes through the Miniconda Python package managing system."
