You can search for research project focusing on a certain topic and download the data they have deposited to SRA. It is publicly accessible. \n",

Basically, the check marks under \"Summary\" will tell you whether the sequences are good or bad. If you see multiple red crosses, that means the sequences are of poor or bad quality and shouldn't be used right away until further processing is done. An example of a good and a bad sequencing run are shown here:\n",

    "A few things to note about the histograms in the first plot. You can see that each sequence is 301 basepair long and the histogram is basically trying to depict average sequence quality within a given window of sequence. You will notice that average sequence quality starts to drop as you go towards the end of the sequence. This is due to the nature of Illumina sequencing technology. It uses fluorescent molecules to record unique bases (A, C, G, T), and the fluorescence signal fades towards the later cycles of sequencing. This makes it difficult to confidently assign correct letters of DNA towards the end and the instrument records lower read qualities near the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing you want to watch out for is the presence of \"adapter\" sequences (near the bottom of the report). See an example of bad sequence report. If the adapter sequences (which are artificial DNA constructs to facilitate sequencing) are left in the sequences for whatever reason, `fastqc` will detect it. In this bad sequence example, you will notice that the adapter content histogram starts to increase near the end of the sequences. If you see something like this, you will need to remove the adapter sequences before the sequences can be used in genome assemblies or other analyses.\n",

It is a command line tool that can be used to transfer files between two remote computers or even for syncing directories inside the same computer. You can see some examples of how to use `rsync` here:\n",

Use `fasterq-dump` tool to download this data. I recommend you put it in `data` folder on your computer. These are fairly large files (each about 450 MB).
