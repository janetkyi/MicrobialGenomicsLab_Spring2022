    "`pandoc` is a really handy tool for a lot of bioinformaticians due to its ability to inter-convert between different document formats. For example, if you want to convert a simple text file into a Word document or a PDF file, you can convert it within a command line environment. Its usefulness will become highly evident in work settings where you need to generate documents or reports on the fly as a part of a bioinformatic workflow or a pipeline, for example.\n",

But it will usually look very long and it may be a bit harder to fit it all in your terminal window. Therefore, I type \"\\\\\" (backslash) to tell the shell (your Unix environment) that the command is not over yet and continues in the next line. The backslash is a special character in the Unix environment and is the mirror of \"/\" (Slash). Programmers use it as an \"escape\" character to specify something. In this example, it allows you to escape the end of line and continues the next line.\n",
