    "[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a markup language to create rich text and designed to make it easy to read and write using just plain text editors. It serves similar purpose as html language (another markup language) to format text on web pages. It is becoming quite common and becoming a sort of standard language people use to format text in places like Github or in other code repositories. Other similar markup languages are [Textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)) and [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, I will be teaching you to learn to use this markup language to format text and documents that may need to be submitted as reports or research projects. We will go into those in a little later. Even in Jupyter lab, you will see that it uses Markdown to format text so that it is easy to write/read and to quickly publish.\n",

    "A few basic things about Markdown syntax here. If you want to write a header line, you provide \"#\" sign in front of the text. You can put 1, 2, or 3 \"#\" signs in front of some text and it will format different levels of headers for you. For example, if you type like this in a Markdown file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Text\n",
    "## Text\n",
